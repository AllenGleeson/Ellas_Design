                In
                his
                youth, he
                sought adventure and the unknown,
                but that had been years ago. He wished he could go back and learn to find the excitement that came with
                change
                but it was useless.
                That curiosity had long left him to where he had come to loathe anything that put him out of his comfort
                zone.
